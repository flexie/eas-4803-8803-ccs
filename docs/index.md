### Course Description 

*Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is widely considered as a key technology to combat climate change. This course presents a comprehensive review how seismic imaging can be used to monitor underground storage of carbon dioxide. Topics covered include basics of seismic data acquisition, wave propagation, and imaging, empirical relations between seismic and fluid-flow properties, two-phase flow equations describing CO~2~ plumes, and the challenges of designing a seismic monitoring system for geologic CO~2~ storage.*

### Homework 

There will be homework exercises, which will mostly involve geophysics-related programs, computer simulations, and data analysis. These assignments is designed for each student to work by him/herself. This [homework](homework.md) will count as 35% of your overall course grade.


### Project

You are required to write a term paper on any topic related to monitoring of geologic CO~2~ storage. This can be a literature review of a selected topic, or research project involving calculations, data analysis, or theoretical results done in consultation with the instructor. The topic needs to be approved by the instructor before the midterm. Your paper should be written up in a journal form with length, figures and referencing in a format suitable for submission to journals like Geophysical Research Letters (GRL). Preliminary version of the final paper should be shown to the instructor for approval at least two weeks before the final due date. You will present your term paper in a 15 minute AGU-style talk; a 12 minute presentation with 3 minutes of questions. The project will count as 15% of your overall course grade. Grading for your project will be based on the 12% of the quality of the research and the written paper, and 3% of your presentation.

You can find more details on the [Projects](project.md) page.

### Exams 

There will be a midterm (25%) and a final exam (25%). Both of them are closed book. Reference to texts or other documents such as previous semester course materials during exams is strictly forbidden. Using these materials will be considered a direct violation of academic policy and will be dealt with according to the GT Academic Honor Code. The use of electronic devices (e.g. cellular phones, computers etc.) other than non-programmable calculators during exams and quizzes is not allowed. 


### Evaluation

- Homework assignments (35%)

- Midterm exam (25%)

- Course project (15%)

- Final exam (25%)

## Academic Honesty

It is expected that all students are aware of their individual responsibilities under the Georgia Tech Academic Honor Code, which will be strictly adhered to in this class. The complete text of the Georgia Tech Academic Honor Code is at [http://www.honor.gatech.edu/](http://www.honor.gatech.edu/).
