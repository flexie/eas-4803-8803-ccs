### Course Description 

<!-- *Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is widely considered as a key scalable negative-emission technology to help combat climate change. This course presents a comprehensive review on how seismic imaging can be used to monitor underground (geologic) storage of carbon dioxide. The course covers the [Basics of Geological Carbon Storage](outline.md), [Design & Scale Up](outline.md), and [Seismic Monitoring](outline.md).*  -->

*Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is widely considered as a key scalable net-negative CO~2~ emission technology to help combat climate change. The course covers the Basics of [Geological Carbon Storage]((outline.md)), its [Design & Scale Up]((outline.md)), and its [Seismic Monitoring]((outline.md)). Aside from reviewing the geophysical challenges and computational aspects of monitoring Geological Carbon Storage, the course also addresses societal impact of this technology. Its (perceived) risk will be discussed by weighting the risk of doing something, by injecting CO~2~ underground, against doing nothing.*


### COVID

Georgia Tech is committed to promoting a campus community that supports holistic well-being, as well as empowering students to make choices that enable positive health outcomes. As we continue to live and learn through a pandemic, Georgia Tech strongly encourages students to utilize several tools not only to reduce their own risks of infection from Covid-19, but also to help reduce the overall levels of transmission in the community.

These tools include: 

1. Getting fully vaccinated. Getting vaccinated at Tech is easy and free.

1. Wearing face coverings consistently in all indoor settings and also in outdoor settings when in close proximity to others.

1. Getting tested on a regular basis, regardless of whether you are vaccinated or asymptomatic. No appointment is needed for Georgia Tech’s asymptomatic testing, and it is free.

1. Avoiding touching your face until you have cleaned your hands with soap and water or used hand sanitizer.

1. Immediately self-quarantining or self-isolating if you experience any symptoms that could be related to Covid-19 or if you have tested positive for Covid-19.

Additional information and resources are available on the [Tech Moving Forward website](https://w3.health.itg.gatech.edu/tech-moving-forward).

#### Information Related to Covid-19

Students are expected to be familiar with and abide by the Institute guidelines, information, and updates related to Covid-19. Find campus operational updates, Frequently Asked Questions, and details on campus surveillance testing and vaccine appointments on the [Tech Moving Forward website](https://w3.health.itg.gatech.edu/tech-moving-forward).

#### Recordings of Class Sessions and Required Permissions

Classes may not be recorded by students without the express consent of the instructor unless it is pursuant to an accommodation granted by the Office of Disability services. Class recordings, lectures, presentations, and other materials posted on Canvas are for the sole purpose of educating the students currently enrolled in the course.

Students may not record or share the materials or recordings, including screen capturing or automated bots, unless the instructor gives permission. Digitally proctored exams may require students to engage the video camera, but those recordings will not be shared with or disclosed to others without consent unless legally permitted.

- For classes where participation is voluntary, students who participate with their camera engaged or utilize a profile image are agreeing to have their video or image recorded.

- For classes requiring class participation, if students are identifiable by their names, facial images, voices, and/ or comments, written consent must be obtained before sharing the recording with persons outside of currently enrolled students in the class.

## Homework 

There will be homework exercises that will mostly involve geophysics-related programs, computer simulations, and data analysis. These assignments are designed for each student to work one by him/herself. Collaboration is to a reasonable degree encouraged. This [homework](homework.md) will count towards 35% of your overall course grade.

## Project
Toward the end of the term, you will work on a computational project entailing the different topics covered during the course. You can find more details on the [Projects](project.md) page. This [project](project.md) will count towards 15% of your overall course grade.

## Exams 

There will be a midterm (25%) and a final exam (25%). Both of them are closed book. Reference to texts or other documents such as previous semester course materials during exams is strictly forbidden. Using these materials will be considered a direct violation of academic policy and will be dealt with according to the GT Academic Honor Code. The use of electronic devices (e.g. cellular phones, computers etc.) other than non-programmable calculators during exams and quizzes is not allowed. 

## Evaluation

- Homework assignments (35%)

- Midterm exam (25%)

- Course project (15%)

- Final exam (25%)

## Academic Honesty

It is expected that all students are aware of their individual responsibilities under the Georgia Tech Academic Honor Code, which will be strictly adhered to in this class. The complete text of the Georgia Tech Academic Honor Code is at [http://www.honor.gatech.edu/](http://www.honor.gatech.edu/).
