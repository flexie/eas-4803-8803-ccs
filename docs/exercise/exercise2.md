# Exercise 2

## Question 1

In the lectures, we learn from slide 25 of lecture 5&6 that the capacity coefficient of a reservoir can be computed by

$C_c = \frac{V_{injected}}{V_{PV}} = \frac{Q_{well}t}{\phi B\pi r_{max}^2}$

Now assume the reservoir is in a circular shape, and

(i) 7 million metric ton of supercritical CO$_2$ is injected every year    
(ii) reservoir is 200m thick and 10km wide (diameter)      
(iii) porosity of rocks in the reservoir is 30%     

### Q1.1

Please calculate the reservoir capacity coefficient after 20, 30, 50, 100 years of injection.

### Q1.2

Please calculate the reservoir capacity coefficient after 20, 30, 50, 100 years of injection if the shape of reservoir is a cone instead of a circular shape (width remains the same).

### Q1.3

Please calculate the reservoir capacity coefficient after 20, 30, 50, 100 years of injection if the porosity of the rocks in the left half of the circular reservoir is changed to 20%.

### Q1.4

Briefly discuss how you would calculate the capacity coefficient if the reservoir is in an irregular shape with hetergeneous porosity.
