# Exercise 1

## Question 1

In the lectures, we learn from slide 40 of lecture 1 that the thickness of a gas or oil column can be retained by

```math #thick

z_g =  \frac{2 \gamma \cos\theta (1/r_{cap}-1/r_{res})}{g (\rho_w-\rho_g)}

```

Assume:

1. caprock is in micropores, reservoir rock is in macropores (follow table 2 of [https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s13202-021-01298-9.pdf](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s13202-021-01298-9.pdf))
2. the contact angle ``\theta`` is ``60`` degress
3. the interfacial tension is ``30`` mN/m
4. gravity acceleration constant is ``9.8`` m/s``^2``
5. water density is ``1000`` kg/m``^3``, super critical CO``_2`` density is ``776`` kg/m``^3``

What is the estimated range of ``z_g``?
