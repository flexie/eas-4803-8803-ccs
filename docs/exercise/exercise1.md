# Exercise 1

## Question 1

In the lectures, we learn from slide 40 of lecture 1 that the thickness of a gas or oil column can be retained by

```math #thick

z_g =  \frac{2 \gamma \cos\theta (1/r_{cap}-1/r_{res})}{g (\rho_w-\rho_g)}

```

Please estimate the range of ``z_g`` for a CO``_2`` reservoir. Free feel to search for some values in this formula and you can also follow some of the references below
