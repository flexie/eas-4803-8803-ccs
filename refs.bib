Since October 1996, Statoil and its Sleipner partners have injected CO2 into a saline aquifer, the Utsira Sand, at a depth of approximately 1000 m. The aquifer has a thickness of more than 200 m near the injection site and is sealed by thick shales. A multi-institutional research project, SACS (Saline Aquifer CO2 Storage), was formed to predict and monitor the migration of the injected CO2. To this end, two time-lapse seismic surveys over the injection area have been acquired, one in October 1999, after 2.3 million tonnes of CO2 had been injected, and the second in October 2001, after approximately 4.4 million tonnes of CO2 had been injected. Comparison with the base seismic survey of 1994 prior to injection provides insights into the development of the CO2 plume. This chapter presents some selected results of the seismic interpretation of the CO2 plume at the two different time-steps.The overall effect of the accumulated CO2 on the seismic signal is significant. At several depth levels within the Utsira Sand, a large increase in reflectivity has been observed on the time-lapse seismic data caused by individual CO2 accumulations under the intra-reservoir shale layers.}

abstract = {The Sleipner CO2 injection project was the world's first industrial offshore CO2 Capture and Storage (CCS) project with more than 16 Mt CO2 injected since 1996. Key monitoring insights from Sleipner are the dual interpretation of seismic and gravimetric monitoring surveys to quantify the free CO2 mass changes and plume geometry development as a function of time. The learnings from Sleipner have contributed to making guidelines for monitoring future CCS injection projects, showing that selection of monitoring technology and the timing and extent of monitoring surveys should be case specific and risk based, while also taking into account the long term nature of CCS projects.}

abstract = { CO2 storage in saline aquifers offers a realistic means of achieving globally significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions at the scale of billions of tonnes per year. We review insights into the processes involved using well-documented industrial-scale projects, supported by a range of laboratory analyses, field studies, and flow simulations. The main topics we address are (a) the significant physicochemical processes, (b) the factors limiting CO2 storage capacity, and (c) the requirements for global scale-up.Although CO2 capture and storage (CCS) technology can be considered mature and proven, it requires significant and rapid scale-up to meet the objectives of the Paris Climate Agreement. The projected growth in the number of CO2 injection wells required is significantly lower than the historic petroleum industry drill rates, indicating that decarbonization via CCS is a highly credible and affordable ambition for modern human society. Several technology developments are needed to reduce deployment costs and to stimulate widespread adoption of this technology, and these should focus on demonstration of long-term retention and safety of CO2 storage and development of smart ways of handling injection wells and pressure, cost-effective monitoring solutions, and deployment of CCS hubs with associated infrastructure. }

abstract = {In the paper we share our operational experience gained from three sites: Sleipner (14 years of injection), In Salah (6 years) and Snøhvit (2 years). Together, these three sites have disposed 16 Mt of CO2 by 2010. In highly variable reservoirs, with permeability ranging from a few milliDarcy to more than one Darcy, single wells have injected several hundred Kt of CO2 per year. In the reservoirs, the actual CO2 plume development has been strongly controlled by geological factors that we learned about during injection. Geophysical monitoring methods (especially seismic, gravity, and satellite data) have, at each site, revealed some of these unpredicted geological factors. Thus monitoring methods are as valuable for reservoir characterisation as they are for monitoring fluid saturation and pressure changes. Current scientific debates that address CO2 storage capacity mainly focus on the utilization of the pore space (efficiency) and the rate of pressure dissipation in response to injection (pressure limits). We add to this that detailed CO2 site characterisation and monitoring is needed to prove significant practical CO2 storage capacity–on a case by case basis. As this specific site experience and knowledge develops more general conclusions on storage capacity, injectivity and efficiency may be possible.}
