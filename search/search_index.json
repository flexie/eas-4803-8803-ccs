The course covers the Basics of Geological Carbon Storage , its Design & Scale Up , and its Seismic Monitoring . Aside from reviewing the geophysical challenges and computational aspects of monitoring Geological Carbon Storage, the course also addresses societal impact of this technology. Its (perceived) risk will be discussed by weighting the risk of doing something, by injecting CO 2 underground, against doing nothing. COVID \u00b6 Georgia Tech is committed to promoting a campus community that supports holistic well-being, as well as empowering students to make choices that enable positive health outcomes. As we continue to live and learn through a pandemic, Georgia Tech strongly encourages students to utilize several tools not only to reduce their own risks of infection from Covid-19, but also to help reduce the overall levels of transmission in the community. These tools include: Getting fully vaccinated. Getting vaccinated at Tech is easy and free. Wearing face coverings consistently in all indoor settings and also in outdoor settings when in close proximity to others. Getting tested on a regular basis, regardless of whether you are vaccinated or asymptomatic. No appointment is needed for Georgia Tech\u2019s asymptomatic testing, and it is free. Avoiding touching your face until you have cleaned your hands with soap and water or used hand sanitizer. Immediately self-quarantining or self-isolating if you experience any symptoms that could be related to Covid-19 or if you have tested positive for Covid-19. Additional information and resources are available on the Tech Moving Forward website . Information Related to Covid-19 \u00b6 Students are expected to be familiar with and abide by the Institute guidelines, information, and updates related to Covid-19. Find campus operational updates, Frequently Asked Questions, and details on campus surveillance testing and vaccine appointments on the Tech Moving Forward website . Recordings of Class Sessions and Required Permissions \u00b6 Classes may not be recorded by students without the express consent of the instructor unless it is pursuant to an accommodation granted by the Office of Disability services. Class recordings, lectures, presentations, and other materials posted on Canvas are for the sole purpose of educating the students currently enrolled in the course. Students may not record or share the materials or recordings, including screen capturing or automated bots, unless the instructor gives permission. Digitally proctored exams may require students to engage the video camera, but those recordings will not be shared with or disclosed to others without consent unless legally permitted. For classes where participation is voluntary, students who participate with their camera engaged or utilize a profile image are agreeing to have their video or image recorded. For classes requiring class participation, if students are identifiable by their names, facial images, voices, and/ or comments, written consent must be obtained before sharing the recording with persons outside of currently enrolled students in the class.

You are encouraged to install Julia on your system following the script to run some basic coding experiments to explore its usage and applications in scientific computing community. In particular, you will run numerical experiments for CO \\(_2\\) dynamics simulation and also seismic wave-based simulations with academically developed softwares. To help you run these software, we highly recommend you use Docker, a platform which builds a virtual machine/container for you with the docker image, which is set-up by us and equipped with pre-installed softwares. The docker image is quite necessary for you to run the software without the tedious installation process, and to provide you with an environment on which the software runs out of the box. First install docker for your system following the instruction here, https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop After succesfull docker instalation, next step is to download docker image of the fluid flow and seismic imaging software and their dependencies and run it in a container. This step will be demonstrated in the class but try and familiarize yourself with the following steps. Instead of having to install Python, Julia, Devito, JUDI, Jutul (Subsurface fluid flow tool) and all the dependencies (these are the softwares that you will use for the numerical simulation) by yourself, you simply download the docker image and run it in a container. All you need to do is install docker, click the docker icon/app or open the terminal/command line ( powershell in windows, also see this ) on your system, and run: docker run --platform linux/x86_64 --env JULIA_NUM_THREADS=4 -p 8888:8888 -v /path/on/your/machine:/notebooks apgahlot/ccsenv:1.0 where /path/on/your/machine is an absolute path on your own local machine. For example, if I want to connect the folder called testdocker on the desktop of my laptop, I can do docker run --platform linux/x86_64 --env JULIA_NUM_THREADS=4 -p 8888:8888 -v /Users/abhinav/Desktop/testdocker:/notebooks apgahlot/ccsenv:1.0 This will download the image and launch a jupyter notebook that you can access from your internet browser. The command will display a link, which looks something like this: Copy/paste this URL into your browser when you connect for the first time, to login with a token: http://0e27b13128d4:8888/?token=84a95cf4319e8e68534f20c7c6474d9875f13c70270f35f4&token=84a95cf4319e8e68534f20c7c6474d9875f13c70270f35f4 Copy-paste the link that you get and replace the address 0e27b13128d4:8888 with localhost:8888 (the link is created inside the docker container, which doesn't know that you mapped this port to your localhost w/ port no. 8888). Then, you can create a notebook there by clicking new -> notebook -> julia 1.7.1, and run the julia code in the jupyter notebook. Try running these packages in notebook for fun using JutulDarcyAD using LinearAlgebra using PyPlot using SlimPlotting using JLD2, Polynomials, Images Whatever you do on the docker container will be saved in the local testdocker folder. And then you need to copy the homework notebook once it is released to this folder and run your codes in that notebook. Instead of a notebook, you can also launch an interactive session with a terminal by running: docker run -it apgahlot/ccsenv:1.0 /bin/bash This will give you access to a terminal, in which you can start Julia/Python, run a couple of lines of code interactively. However, figures from PyPlot (the plotting package) sometimes do not render well from interactive julia sessions. Therefore, jupyter notebooks on docker are recommended for you to do the assignments. Number of cores/threads \u00b6 By default, the command docker run --platform linux/x86_64 --env JULIA_NUM_THREADS=4 -p 8888:8888 -v /path/on/your/machine:/notebooks apgahlot/ccsenv:1.0 will use 4 threads because in the above command JULIA_NUM_THREADS=4 is set. If you want to increase the number of threads to run your code faster, you need to know the number of threads on your machine and then set JULIA_NUM_THREADS equal to that number. To know the number of threads on your machine you can do: For Mac, write on terminal: sysctl -n hw.logicalcpu For Linux, write on terminal: lscpu The number of threads = number of threads per core * No. of CPUs For windows: Follow this link Window Users \u00b6 If you are using windows, you might need to enable hardware virtualization in their BIOS. You are suggested to look at here and here . If you have any question, please reach out to us ASAP.

A simple band-pass filter looks like this: F_hp = ones(length(f),length(h)) F_hp[(f.<5) .| (f.>20.),:] .= 0 imshow(F_hp, extent=[h[end], h[1], f[end], f[1]], aspect=20) colorbar() xlabel(\"offset [m]\");ylabel(\"frequency [Hz]\") PyObject Text(24.000000000000007, 0.5, 'frequency [Hz]') The filtered data looks like this imshow(fftrl(F_hp.*Data_fh, f, -1)[1], cmap=\"Greys\", vmin=-1, vmax=1, extent=[h[end], h[1], T[end], T[1]], aspect=1000) xlabel(\"offset [m]\");ylabel(\"frequency [Hz]\") PyObject Text(24.000000000000007, 0.5, 'frequency [Hz]') Do you see the artifacts?

JOLI \u00b6 https://github.com/slimgroup/JOLI.jl The JOLI toolbox gives a way to represent matrices implicitly. A nice example is the Fourier transform. In julia, the Fourier transform of a vector is given by fft(x). We can explicitly construct a matrix representing the Fourier transform as follows using FFTW # dimension N = 10 F1 = zeros(Complex{Float64}, N,N) for k = 1:N # construct k-th unit vector ek = zeros(N,1) ek[k] = 1 # make column of matrix F1[:, k]= fft(ek) end Look at the matrix, what do you notice? Verify that it gives the same result as fft by trying on a vector We can also define the FFT using JOLI: using JOLI F2 = joDFT(N) varinfo(r\"F1\"), varinfo(r\"F2\") (| name | size | summary | |:---- | ---------:|:------------------------------- | | F1 | 1.602 KiB | 10\u00d710 Array{Complex{Float64},2} | , | name | size | summary | |:---- | ---------:|:------------------------------------------ | | F2 | 566 bytes | joLinearFunction{Float64,Complex{Float64}} | ) And this is only a small example! The reason why we want to have such operations behave like matrices is that we can use (some) standard algorithms that where written to work with matrices to work with large scale operations.

Use joDirac to define an identity operator. Apply the operators C and S to the vector r to get something that resembles NMO-corrected data. You can reshape the vector into a matrix by using reshape. Plot the result. The next step is to construct an NMO operator. Please follow the function nmo in Exercise2 and define a JOLI operator for a constant velocity of 2000 m/s. Don't forget to take care of the shape of input and output (they should both be vectors in proper lengths). You can do this by simply filling the blanks below.

Check that your combined operator satisfies the dottest Make data for the spike train r and add some noise. Invert the operator with both lsqr and spgl1 (see previous exercise). Inverting the Radon transform \u00b6 In the previous exercise we saw that the Radon transform is not unitary. This means that its adjoint is not its inverse. Here, we will set up a JOLI operator for the Radon transform and invert it using lsqr and spgl1.

First, define a time and offset axis. # time and offset grid t = Float64.(0:.004:1); nt = length(t); h = Float64.(0.0:10.0:1000.0); nh = length(h); We make a reflectivity series with 3 spikes and define a wavelet. # reflectivity r = zeros(nt,1); r[51] = 1 r[101] = -.5 r[151] = .75 # wavelet w = (1 .-2*1e3*(t .-.1).^2).*exp.(-1e3 .*(t .-.1).^2) 251-element Array{Float64,1}: -0.0008625986654872107 -0.0017333620023927386 -0.003359640068423334 -0.00627815407118934 -0.011305429764281264 -0.019606375823452423 -0.032722754572662376 -0.05251269265727092 -0.08094144772594736 -0.11966839901351634 -0.16940707917321376 -0.22910148611303477 -0.29505929933463465 \u22ee -8.75952886e-316 -9.2021e-319 -0.0 -0.0 -0.0 -0.0 -0.0 -0.0 -0.0 -0.0 -0.0 -0.0 The convolution is done by using the FFT SPOT operators, just like in the last exercise. # convolution operator C = joDFT(nt)'*joDiag(fft(w))*joDFT(nt); Next, we need to extend the the reflectivity to be a function of time and offset. We are trying to undo the stack operation to create NMO corrected data. Let's first look at the stack. Given a matrix, we can stack the columns by multiplying with a vector of all ones: # test matrix X =[1 2; 3 4; 5 6] Y = X*[1;1] 3-element Array{Int64,1}: 3 7 11 Construct a JOLI operator that stacks a vectorized input matrix of size nt x nh along the columns. Use joDirac to define an identity operator. Apply the operators C and S to the vector r to get something that resembles NMO-corrected data. You can reshape the vector into a matrix by using reshape. Plot the result. The next step is to construct an NMO operator. Please follow the function nmo in Exercise2 and define a JOLI operator for a constant velocity of 2000 m/s. Don't forget to take care of the shape of input and output (they should both be vectors in proper lengths). You can do this by simply filling the blanks below. Apply it to the result of the previous exercise and plot the result. function nmo(cmp, t, off, v,flag) # NMO correction and adjoint # # use: # out = nmo(in,t,h,v,flag) # # input: # in - data matrix of size [length(t) x length(h)], each column is a trace # t - time vector [s] # offsets - offset vector [m] # v - NMO velocity [m/s] as vector of size [length(t) x 1]. # flag - 1:forward, -1:adjoint # # output # out - data matrix of size [length(t) x length(h)], each column is a trace if size(cmp, 2) == 1 return cmp end # size of data nt, nh = size(cmp) # make sure t and v are column vectors t = t[:] v = v[:] # initialize output out = zeros(nt, nh) # loop over offset for i = 1:nh # NMO traveltime tau = sqrt.(t.^2 + off[i].^2 ./v.^2); A = getLA(t,tau); # interpolate, forward or adjoint new = zeros(size(out[:,i])) if flag == 1 new[1:size(A*cmp[:,i])[1]] = A*cmp[:,i] else new[1:size(A'*cmp[:,i])[1]] = A'*cmp[:,i] end out[:,i] = new[1:nt] #cmp end return vec(out) end function nmo_forward(vec_cmp,t,h,vel) mat_cmp = _ # to be done return nmo(mat_cmp,t,h,vel,1) end function nmo_adjoint(vec_cmp,t,h,vel) mat_cmp = _ # to be done return nmo(mat_cmp,t,h,vel,-1) end function joNMO(t,h,vel, n) C = joLinearFunctionFwd_T(n, n, v -> nmo_forward(v, t,h,vel), w -> nmo_adjoint(w, t,h,vel), Float64, Float64,name=\"NMO operator\") end B = joNMO(_, _, _, _) Now, define a combined operator that predicts data given a spike train. Check that your combined operator satisfies the dottest Make data for the spike train r and add some noise.

A couple of things before we go into the details: 1. Try to give your interpretation to every figure you plot. What is each event in the figure? \u00b6 2. Plotting is hard. When you make plots, make sure you use the correct labels and units so that images are in meters, data is in seconds. Also make sure you clip the image by vmin and vmax keywords in imshow function so that you see all the events in the image. \u00b6 3. To plot seismic data and images (e.g. RTM), we always put vmin = -vmax so that \\(0\\) is at the center in your colorscale.

Do rtm.data to access the value. Again take care of vmin, vmax, aspect of plotting. Least-squares reverse time migration (LS-RTM) \u00b6 Seismic imaging researchers are not always satisfied with RTM. Seismic imaging basically solves the optimization problem \\(\\min_{\\mathbf{\\delta m}} \\|\\mathbf{J}\\mathbf{\\delta m} - \\mathbf{\\delta d}\\|_2^2\\) where RTM is only taking a full gradient of the objective w.r.t. \\(\\delta \\mathbf{m}\\) .

What do you see? Remember, our goal is to get an image that is similar to the true dm . \u00b6 Task: The seismic images (except for the true dm ) above are focusing mainly in the central region. Why? (Hint: check source/receiver locations) How can we get a full illumination of the image? Make experiments to verify. \u00b6 Task: change acquisition to be transmission -- e.g. put sources as a vertical line on the left, receivers on the right. Show what RTM image looks like.

Once you have your script, e.g.: hello-world.jl println(\"Hello world\") Hello world you can run the script with include(\"hello-world.jl\").

Similarly, you can enter the shell mode by typing ;, which gives you access to a full bash terminal. ; pwd /home/yzhang3198 In contrast to Matlab, Julia treats all operators as functions. This means you can add two numbers in either of the two ways: a = 4 + 5 9 a = +(4, 5) 9 The same applies for any other operations, such as subtraction, multiplications etc. Some math constants are defined in Julia by default, such as: print(pi) \u03c0 Julia was designed with the intend to write code that resembles mathematics as close as possible.

Some other differences between Matlab and Julia are min and max functions. These functions only return the min/max of two input variables: min(5,100) 5 To obtain the smallest/largest entry of a vector, use the minimum and maximum functions: x = [1,2,3,4,5,6] println(minimum(x)) println(maximum(x)) 1 6 Controll Flow \u00b6 Control flow in Julia, i.e. if/else statements, for loops or while loops, are similar to other programming languages. Here are some examples of different ways of controlling the flow: for j=1:2:8 println(j) end 1 3 5 7 for color in [\"red\", \"green\", \"blue\"] # an array print(color, \" \") end red green blue x = 10 while x > 1 x -= 1 println(x) end 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 name = \"Julia\" if name == \"Julia\" println(\"I like Julia\") elseif name == \"Python\" println(\"I like Python.\") println(\"But I prefer Julia.\") else println(\"I don't know what I like\") end I like Julia Functions \u00b6 Functions are a useful building block to structure your code and build subroutines etc. The most generic way to define functions in Julia is like this: function my_function(arg1, arg2) # do some work end my_function (generic function with 1 method) Functions can have any number of input arguments, including none: function breakfast() maketoast() brewcoffee() end breakfast (generic function with 1 method) By default, Julia functions always return the output from the last line of function. By using the return keyword, you can indicate a specific value that should be returned. function my_func(x, y) x_new = 2x y_new = 2y end z = my_func(3,4) 8 function my_func(x, y) return x_new = 2x y_new = 2y end z = my_func(3,4) 6 By grouping results as tuples, it is possible to return multiple variables: function my_func(x, y) x_new = 2x y_new = 2y return (x_new, y_new) end z = my_func(3,4) (6, 8)","title":"A quick introduction to the Julia language"},{"location":"Assignments/introduction_to_julia/#a-quick-introduction-to-the-julia-language","text":"Getting started Start an interactive Julia session by running julia from the command line.

Once you have your script, e.g.: hello-world.jl println(\"Hello world\") Hello world you can run the script with include(\"hello-world.jl\").

Similarly, you can enter the shell mode by typing ;, which gives you access to a full bash terminal. ; pwd /home/yzhang3198 In contrast to Matlab, Julia treats all operators as functions. This means you can add two numbers in either of the two ways: a = 4 + 5 9 a = +(4, 5) 9 The same applies for any other operations, such as subtraction, multiplications etc. Some math constants are defined in Julia by default, such as: print(pi) \u03c0 Julia was designed with the intend to write code that resembles mathematics as close as possible. For example, you can omit the multiplication operator when working with variables: x = 5 2x + 4 # which is the same as 2*x + 4 14 Just as Matlab, but different than Python, Julia comes with many built-in math functions that you would need for everyday use: sin(pi / 2) 1.0 log(100) 4.605170185988092 exp(4.3) 73.69979369959579 rand() 0.24072220081526052","title":"A quick introduction to the Julia language"},{"location":"Assignments/introduction_to_julia/#packages-and-plotting","text":"Packages provide additional functionalities, that are not included in core Julia.
