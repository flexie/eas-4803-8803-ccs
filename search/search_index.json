This course presents a comprehensive review how seismic imaging can be used to monitor underground (geologic) storage of carbon dioxide. Topics covered include basics of seismic data acquisition, wave propagation, and imaging, empirical relations between seismic and fluid-flow properties, two-phase flow equations describing CO 2 plumes, and the challenges of designing a seismic monitoring system for geologic CO 2 storage. COVID Georgia Tech is committed to promoting a campus community that supports holistic well-being, as well as empowering students to make choices that enable positive health outcomes. As we continue to live and learn through a pandemic, Georgia Tech strongly encourages students to utilize several tools not only to reduce their own risks of infection from Covid-19, but also to help reduce the overall levels of transmission in the community. These tools include: Getting fully vaccinated. Getting vaccinated at Tech is easy and free. Wearing face coverings consistently in all indoor settings and also in outdoor settings when in close proximity to others. Getting tested on a regular basis, regardless of whether you are vaccinated or asymptomatic. No appointment is needed for Georgia Tech\u2019s asymptomatic testing, and it is free. Avoiding touching your face until you have cleaned your hands with soap and water or used hand sanitizer. Immediately self-quarantining or self-isolating if you experience any symptoms that could be related to Covid-19 or if you have tested positive for Covid-19. Additional information and resources are available on the Tech Moving Forward website . Information Related to Covid-19 Students are expected to be familiar with and abide by the Institute guidelines, information, and updates related to Covid-19. Find campus operational updates, Frequently Asked Questions, and details on campus surveillance testing and vaccine appointments on the Tech Moving Forward website . Recordings of Class Sessions and Required Permissions Classes may not be recorded by students without the express consent of the instructor unless it is pursuant to an accommodation granted by the Office of Disability services. Class recordings, lectures, presentations, and other materials posted on Canvas are for the sole purpose of educating the students currently enrolled in the course. Students may not record or share the materials or recordings, including screen capturing or automated bots, unless the instructor gives permission. Digitally proctored exams may require students to engage the video camera, but those recordings will not be shared with or disclosed to others without consent unless legally permitted. For classes where participation is voluntary, students who participate with their camera engaged or utilize a profile image are agreeing to have their video or image recorded. For classes requiring class participation, if students are identifiable by their names, facial images, voices, and/ or comments, written consent must be obtained before sharing the recording with persons outside of currently enrolled students in the class.

Seismic data are typically stored in a special binary format: SEGY. These file-formats store the data as mutliple time-series (traces) with the corresponding header information containing specific information about such as time sampling and source/receiver locations. The Julia utilities for reading SEGY data is SegyIO using Pkg #Pkg.clone(\"https://github.com/slimgroup/SegyIO.jl.git\") #Pkg.add(\"PyPlot\") using SegyIO, PyPlot Scaning the dataset Thhe first step is to scan the dataset to extract header/metadat. This metadat contains the geometry and parameters of the survey such as the source/receiver locations and time sampling rate. The convention for the metadata is as follows: The Source positions use the Source keyword such as SourceX The receiver position use the Group keyword such as GroupX # scan the dataset dir = Pkg.dir(\"SegyIO\") data_dir = \"data\" \u250c Warning: `Pkg.dir(pkgname, paths...)` is deprecated; instead, do `import SegyIO; joinpath(dirname(pathof(SegyIO)), \"..\", paths...)`. \u2514 @ Pkg.API /buildworker/worker/package_linux64/build/usr/share/julia/stdlib/v1.2/Pkg/src/API.jl:415 \"data\" We can now scans the dataset with the segy_scan functin.

How can you extraplotate the wavefield in the t-x domain directly using the extrapolator in the t-x domain? Zero-offset migration In this part of the exercise we look at zero-offset migration. This type of migration is based on the \"exploding-reflector\" concept. Zero-offset migration can be done by exptrapolating the zero-offset data with half-velocity and taking the image to be slice of the wavefield at \\(t=0\\) for each depth step: \\(I(z,x) = u(z,x,t=0)\\) The function wave_extrap.m takes in a wavefield u and the correspoding time/space vectors t,x, a velocity v, a depth step dz and a propagation direction dir and extrapolates the input wavefield. Load the zero-offset data data1_zero.segy (in Dropbox) and define the source, receiver and time coordinates. The units of the source and receiver coordinates are in meters for this file.

Perform the convolution using the usual julia commands fft, ifft and element-wise multiplication .*. Creat a JOLI operator to do the same. You can construct an operator to do the multiplication with the filter using joDiag. - Compare the results of both. - Compare f to g, what do you notice? - Assuming that your convolution operator is called C: Now, construct the signal f using your SPOT operator and add some noise (i.e., f = C g + 1e-1 randn(N,1)). Do you think C has a null-space? If so, describe it. (Hint: look at the filter). Use the adjoint of C as an approximation to the inverse, what does this correspond to and what does the reconstruction look like? - Describe how you would invert the system. - Use lsqr to do it. (you might need to increase the number of iterations.) - Look at the signal that is predicted by your reconstruction, do you see a difference with the true signal? lsqr will give us a solution that has a small two-norm and explains the data. Alternatively, we can use another solver that will give us a spiky solution and explains the data. This solver is spgl1. Try spgl1(C,f,0,1e-2). https://github.com/slimgroup/GenSPGL.jl Is this solution closer to the true one? Look at the predicted signal for this solution, do you see a difference with the true signal?

Verify that it gives the same result as fft by trying on a vector We can also define the FFT using JOLI: using JOLI F2 = joDFT(N) joLinearFunction{Float64,Complex{Float64}}(\"joDFTp\", 10, 10, getfield(JOLI, Symbol(\"##837#853\")){DataType,Tuple{Int64},FFTW.cFFTWPlan{Complex{Float64},-1,false,1}}(Complex{Float64}, (10,), FFTW forward plan for 10-element array of Complex{Float64} (dft-direct-10 \"n2fv_10_avx2_128\")), Nullable{Function}(getfield(JOLI, Symbol(\"##240#244\")){getfield(JOLI, Symbol(\"##838#854\")){DataType,Tuple{Int64},AbstractFFTs.ScaledPlan{Complex{Float64},FFTW.cFFTWPlan{Complex{Float64},1,false,1},Float64}}}(getfield(JOLI, Symbol(\"##838#854\")){DataType,Tuple{Int64},AbstractFFTs.ScaledPlan{Complex{Float64},FFTW.cFFTWPlan{Complex{Float64},1,false,1},Float64}}(Float64, (10,), 0.1 * FFTW backward plan for 10-element array of Complex{Float64} (dft-direct-10 \"n2bv_10_avx2_128\")))), Nullable{Function}(getfield(JOLI, Symbol(\"##838#854\")){DataType,Tuple{Int64},AbstractFFTs.ScaledPlan{Complex{Float64},FFTW.cFFTWPlan{Complex{Float64},1,false,1},Float64}}(Float64, (10,), 0.1 * FFTW backward plan for 10-element array of Complex{Float64} (dft-direct-10 \"n2bv_10_avx2_128\"))), Nullable{Function}(getfield(JOLI, Symbol(\"##241#245\")){getfield(JOLI, Symbol(\"##837#853\")){DataType,Tuple{Int64},FFTW.cFFTWPlan{Complex{Float64},-1,false,1}}}(getfield(JOLI, Symbol(\"##837#853\")){DataType,Tuple{Int64},FFTW.cFFTWPlan{Complex{Float64},-1,false,1}}(Complex{Float64}, (10,), FFTW forward plan for 10-element array of Complex{Float64} (dft-direct-10 \"n2fv_10_avx2_128\")))), true, Nullable{Function}(getfield(JOLI, Symbol(\"##839#855\")){DataType,Tuple{Int64},AbstractFFTs.ScaledPlan{Complex{Float64},FFTW.cFFTWPlan{Complex{Float64},1,false,1},Float64}}(Float64, (10,), 0.1 * FFTW backward plan for 10-element array of Complex{Float64} (dft-direct-10 \"n2bv_10_avx2_128\"))), Nullable{Function}(getfield(JOLI, Symbol(\"##242#246\")){getfield(JOLI, Symbol(\"##840#856\")){DataType,Tuple{Int64},FFTW.cFFTWPlan{Complex{Float64},-1,false,1}}}(getfield(JOLI, Symbol(\"##840#856\")){DataType,Tuple{Int64},FFTW.cFFTWPlan{Complex{Float64},-1,false,1}}(Complex{Float64}, (10,), FFTW forward plan for 10-element array of Complex{Float64} (dft-direct-10 \"n2fv_10_avx2_128\")))), Nullable{Function}(getfield(JOLI, Symbol(\"##840#856\")){DataType,Tuple{Int64},FFTW.cFFTWPlan{Complex{Float64},-1,false,1}}(Complex{Float64}, (10,), FFTW forward plan for 10-element array of Complex{Float64} (dft-direct-10 \"n2fv_10_avx2_128\"))), Nullable{Function}(getfield(JOLI, Symbol(\"##243#247\")){getfield(JOLI, Symbol(\"##839#855\")){DataType,Tuple{Int64},AbstractFFTs.ScaledPlan{Complex{Float64},FFTW.cFFTWPlan{Complex{Float64},1,false,1},Float64}}}(getfield(JOLI, Symbol(\"##839#855\")){DataType,Tuple{Int64},AbstractFFTs.ScaledPlan{Complex{Float64},FFTW.cFFTWPlan{Complex{Float64},1,false,1},Float64}}(Float64, (10,), 0.1 * FFTW backward plan for 10-element array of Complex{Float64} (dft-direct-10 \"n2bv_10_avx2_128\")))), true) varinfo(r\"F1\"), varinfo(r\"F2\") (| name | size | summary | |:---- | ---------:|:------------------------------- | | F1 | 1.602 KiB | 10\u00d710 Array{Complex{Float64},2} | , | name | size | summary | |:---- | ---------:|:------------------------------------------ | | F2 | 566 bytes | joLinearFunction{Float64,Complex{Float64}} | ) And this is only a small example!

Inverting the Radon transform In the previous exercise we saw that the Radon transform is not unitary. This means that its adjoint is not its inverse.

What do you see? Why do you observe this theoretically (think about math)? Reverse time migration (RTM) From now on, we will only focusing on migrating the linearized data for simplicity. First, we can try reverse time migration by rtm1 = J'*dlin To make the RTM image cleaner and with higher quality, Witte et al developed an inverse-scattering imaging condition (ISIC), which has been incorporated in JUDI. J.options.isic = true rtm2 = J'*dlin Task: compare RTM results w/ and w/o ISIC, what do you see? Remember again to clip the vmin/vmax to see all the events in the images. # hint: rtm1/rtm2 are PhysicalParameters. Do rtm1.data, rtm2.data to access the value. Again take care of vmin, vmax, aspect of plotting. Least-squares reverse time migration (LS-RTM) Seismic imaging researchers are not always satisfied with RTM. Seismic imaging basically solves the optimization problem \\min_{\\mathbf{\\delta m}} \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i=1}^{n_s}\\|\\mathcal{J}_i\\mathbf{\\delta m} - \\mathbf{\\delta d}\\|_2^2 where RTM is only taking a full gradient of the objective w.r.t. \\delta m . To get better images, we can minimize the objective by LSQR and apply a right preconditioner # Right Preconditioner Tm = judiTopmute(model0.n, 19, 2) # Mute water column S = judiDepthScaling(model0) Mr = S*Tm ## vanilla LSQR x1 = 0f0 .* model0.m lsqr!(x1,J*Mr,dlin;maxiter=2,atol=0f0,verbose=true) The final solution is given by Mr*x1 ( Mr is a right preconditioner so we are actually minimizing \\frac{1}{2}\\|\\mathcal{J}\\mathbf{M_r}\\mathbf{x}- \\mathbf{\\delta d}\\|_2^2 ) Task: compare LS-RTM result with the previous RTM result, what do you see? Sparsity-promoting least-squares reverse time migration (SPLS-RTM) The start-of-the-art imaging technique is to do LS-RTM while promoting sparsity of solution in Curvelet domain, see Witte et al .

Some other differences between Matlab and Julia are min and max functions. These functions only return the min/max of two input variables: min(5,100) 5 To obtain the smallest/largest entry of a vector, use the minimum and maximum functions: x = [1,2,3,4,5,6] println(minimum(x)) println(maximum(x)) 1 6 Controll Flow Control flow in Julia, i.e. if/else statements, for loops or while loops, are similar to other programming languages. Here are some examples of different ways of controlling the flow: for j=1:2:8 println(j) end 1 3 5 7 for color in [\"red\", \"green\", \"blue\"] # an array print(color, \" \") end red green blue x = 10 while x > 1 x -= 1 println(x) end 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 name = \"Julia\" if name == \"Julia\" println(\"I like Julia\") elseif name == \"Python\" println(\"I like Python.\") println(\"But I prefer Julia.\") else println(\"I don't know what I like\") end I like Julia Functions Functions are a useful building block to structure your code and build subroutines etc. The most generic way to define functions in Julia is like this: function my_function(arg1, arg2) # do some work end my_function (generic function with 1 method) Functions can have any number of input arguments, including none: function breakfast() maketoast() brewcoffee() end breakfast (generic function with 1 method) By default, Julia functions always return the output from the last line of function. By using the return keyword, you can indicate a specific value that should be returned. function my_func(x, y) x_new = 2x y_new = 2y end z = my_func(3,4) 8 function my_func(x, y) return x_new = 2x y_new = 2y end z = my_func(3,4) 6 By grouping results as tuples, it is possible to return multiple variables: function my_func(x, y) x_new = 2x y_new = 2y return (x_new, y_new) end z = my_func(3,4) (6, 8)","title":"A quick introduction to the Julia language"},{"location":"Assignments/introduction_to_julia/#a-quick-introduction-to-the-julia-language","text":"Getting started Start an interactive Julia session by running julia from the command line.
