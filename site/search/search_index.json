Some other differences between Matlab and Julia are min and max functions. These functions only return the min/max of two input variables: min(5,100) 5 To obtain the smallest/largest entry of a vector, use the minimum and maximum functions: x = [1,2,3,4,5,6] println(minimum(x)) println(maximum(x)) 1 6 Controll Flow Control flow in Julia, i.e. if/else statements, for loops or while loops, are similar to other programming languages. Here are some examples of different ways of controlling the flow: for j=1:2:8 println(j) end 1 3 5 7 for color in [\"red\", \"green\", \"blue\"] # an array print(color, \" \") end red green blue x = 10 while x > 1 x -= 1 println(x) end 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 name = \"Julia\" if name == \"Julia\" println(\"I like Julia\") elseif name == \"Python\" println(\"I like Python.\") println(\"But I prefer Julia.\") else println(\"I don't know what I like\") end I like Julia Functions Functions are a useful building block to structure your code and build subroutines etc. The most generic way to define functions in Julia is like this: function my_function(arg1, arg2) # do some work end my_function (generic function with 1 method) Functions can have any number of input arguments, including none: function breakfast() maketoast() brewcoffee() end breakfast (generic function with 1 method) By default, Julia functions always return the output from the last line of function. By using the return keyword, you can indicate a specific value that should be returned. function my_func(x, y) x_new = 2x y_new = 2y end z = my_func(3,4) 8 function my_func(x, y) return x_new = 2x y_new = 2y end z = my_func(3,4) 6 By grouping results as tuples, it is possible to return multiple variables: function my_func(x, y) x_new = 2x y_new = 2y return (x_new, y_new) end z = my_func(3,4) (6, 8)","title":"Introduction to julia"},{"location":"Assignments/introduction_to_julia/#a-quick-introduction-to-the-julia-language","text":"","title":"A quick introduction to the Julia language"},{"location":"Assignments/introduction_to_julia/#getting-started","text":"Start an interactive Julia session by running julia from the command line.
